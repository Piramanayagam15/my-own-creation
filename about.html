            <p>
              AK Bridals was born from a simple dream – to make every bride feel
              seen, celebrated, and beautifully herself. What started as a
              passion for makeup and design soon grew into a full-service bridal
              studio, serving brides, families, and students who wish to enter
              the world of bridal artistry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, we have worked with brides across different
              cultures, styles, and age groups, carefully blending traditional
              elements with modern trends to create timeless looks.
